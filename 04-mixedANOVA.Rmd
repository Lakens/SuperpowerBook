# Mixed ANOVA 

##  Two by two ANOVA, within-between design

We can simulate a Two-Way ANOVA with a specific alpha, sample size and effect size, to achieve a specified statistical power. We will try to reproduce the power analysis by G*Power for an F-test from an ANOVA with a repeated measures, within-between interaction effect.

For the 2-way interaction, the result should be a power of 91.25% is we have a total samplesize of 46. Since we have 2 groups in the between factor that means the sample size per group is 2 (and both these groups collect 2 repeated measures). 

```{r start_mixedANOVA}
mu <- c(-0.25, 0.25, 0.25,-0.25)
n <- 23
sd <- 1
r <- 0.5
string = "2w*2b"
alpha_level <- 0.05
labelnames = c("age", "old", "young", "color", "blue", "red")

design_result <- ANOVA_design(
design = string,
n = n,
mu = mu,
sd = sd,
r = r,
labelnames = labelnames
)

### Two by two ANOVA, within-between design Variation 1

We can simulate the same two-way ANOVA increasing the correlation to 0.7.
