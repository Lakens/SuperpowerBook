# Repeated Measures ANOVA 

## Part 1

In a repeated measures design multiple observations are collected from the same participants. In the simplest case, where there are two repeated observations, a repeated measures ANOVA equals a dependent or paired *t*-test. The difference compared to a between subject design is that repeated measures can be correlated, and in psychology, they often are. Let's first explore the impact of this correlation on the power of a repeated measures ANOVA.

### Two conditions, medium effect size

To illustrate the effect of correated observations, we start by simulating data for a medium effect size for a dependent (or paired, or within-subject) *t*-test. Let's first look at G*power. If we want to perform an a-priori power analysis, we are asked to fill in the effect size dz. As Cohen (1988) writes, "The Z subscript is used to emphasize the fact that our raw score unit is no longer X or Y, but Z", where Z are the difference scores of X-Y.

Within designs can have greater power to detect differences than between designs because the values are correlated, and a within design requires less participants because each participant provides multiple observations. One difference between an independent *t*-test and a dependent *t*-test is that an independent *t*-test has 2(n-1) degrees of freedom, while a dependent *t*-test has (n-1) degrees of freedom. The sample size needed in a two-group within-design (NW) relative to the sample needed in two-group between-designs (NB), assuming normal distributions, and ignoring the difference in degrees of freedom between the two types of tests, is (from Maxwell & Delaney, 2004, p. 561, formula 45): 

$N_{W}=\frac{N_{B}(1-\rho)}{2}$

The division by 2 in the equation is due to the fact that in a two-condition within design every participant provides two data-points. The extent to which this reduces the sample size compared to a between-subject design depends on the correlation (*r*) between the two dependent variables, as indicated by the 1-r part of the equation. If the correlation is 0, a within-subject design needs half as many participants as a between-subject design (e.g., 64 instead 128 participants), simply because every participants provides 2 datapoints. The higher the correlation, the larger the relative benefit of within designs, and whenever the correlation is negative (up to -1) the relative benefit disappears. 

Whereas in an independent *t*-test the two observations are uncorrelated, in a within design the observations are correlated. This has an effect on the standard deviation of the difference scores. In turn, because the standardized effect size is the mean difference divided by the standard deviation of the difference scores, the correlation has an effect on the standardized mean difference in a within design, Cohen's dz. The relation, as Cohen (1988, formula 2.3.7) explains, is:

$\sigma_{z}=\sigma\sqrt{2(1-\rho)}$

Therefore, the relation between dz and d is $\sqrt{2(1-\rho)}$. As Cohen (1988) writes: "In other words, a given difference between population means for matched (dependent) samples is standardized by a value which is $\sqrt{2(1-\rho)}$ as large as would be the case were they independent. If we enter a correlation of 0.5 in the formula, we get $\sqrt{2(0.5)}=1$. In other words, when the correlation is 0.5, d = dz. When there is a strong correlation between dependent variables, for example r = 0.9, we get $d=d_{z}\sqrt{2(1-0.9)}$, and a dz of 1 would be a d = 0.45. Reversely, $d_{z}=\frac{d}{\sqrt{2(1-r)}}$, so with a r = 0.9, a d of 1 would be a dz = 2.24. Some consider this increase in dz compared to d when observations are strongly correlated an 'inflation' when estimating effect sizes, but since the reduction in the standard deviation of the difference scores due to the correlation makes it easier to distinguish signal from noise in a hypothesis test, it leads to a clear power benefit. 

```{r start_rmANOVA}
# Check sample size formula Maxwell
# Power is pretty similar with n/2, same d (assuming r = 0.5). 
# Small differences due to df = 2(n-1) vs df = n-1
pwr.t.test(d = 0.05,
           n = c(2000, 4000, 8000),
           sig.level = 0.05,
           type = "two.sample",
           alternative = "two.sided")
pwr.t.test(d = 0.05,
           n = c(1000, 2000, 4000),
           sig.level = 0.05,
           type = "paired",
           alternative = "two.sided")
```

There is no equivalent fz for Cohen's f for a within subject ANOVA. For two groups, we can directly compute Cohen's f from Cohen's d for two groups, as Cohen (1988) describes, because f = 1/2d. For a d = 0.5, f = 0.25. In Gpower we can run a 2 group within-subject power analysis for ANOVA. We plan for 80% power, and reproduce the anaysis above for the dependent *t*-test. This works because the correlation is set to 0.5, when d = dz, and thus the transformation of f=1/2d works.  

![](screenshots/gpower_1.png)

If we change the correlation to 0.7 and keep all other settings the same, the repeated measure a-priori power analysis yields a sample of 21. The correlation increases the power for the test. 

![](screenshots/gpower_11.png)

To reproduce this analysis in Gpower with a dependent *t*-test we need to change dz following the formula above, $d_{z}=\frac{0.5}{\sqrt{2(1-0.7)}}$, which yields dz = `r 0.5/sqrt(2*(1-0.7))`. If we enter this value in Gpower for an a-priori power analysis, we get the exact same results (as we should, since an repeated measures ANOVA with 2 groups equals a dependent *t*-test). This example illustrates that the correlation between dependent variables always factors into a power analysis, both for a dependent *t*-test, and for a repeated measures ANOVA. Because a dependent *t*-test uses dz the correlation might be less visible, but given the relation between d and dz, the correlation is always taken into account and can greatly improve power for within designs compared to between designs.

![](screenshots/gpower_10.png)

We can perform both these power analyses using simuations as well. We set groups to 2 for the simulation, n = 34 (which should give 80.777 power, according to the g*power program), a correlation among repeated measures of 0.5, and an alpha of 0.05. In this case, we simulate data with means -0.25  and 0.25, and set the sd to 1. This means we have a mean difference of 0.5, and a Cohen's d of 0.5/1 = 0.5. In the first example, we set the correlation to 0.5, and the result should be 80.77% power, and an effect size estimate of 0.5 for the simple effect. We also calculate partial eta-squared for the ANOVA, which equals $\frac{f^2}{f^2+1}$, or 0.05882353.

```{r}
K <- 2
n <- 34
sd <- 1
r <- 0.5
alpha = 0.05
f <- 0.25
f2 <- f^2
ES <- f2/(f2 + 1)
ES
mu <- mu_from_ES(K = K, ES = ES)
design = paste(K,"w",sep = "")
labelnames <- c("speed", "fast", "slow")

design_result <- ANOVA_design(design = design,
                   n = n, 
                   mu = mu, 
                   sd = sd, 
                   r = r, 
                   labelnames = labelnames)

alpha_level <- 0.05

simulation_result <- ANOVA_power(design_result, 
                                 alpha_level = alpha_level, 
                                 nsims = nsims,
                                 verbose = FALSE)

knitr::kable(simulation_result$main_results,
             caption = "Simulated ANOVA Result")

exact_result <- ANOVA_exact(design_result,
                            alpha_level = alpha_level,
                            verbose = FALSE)

knitr::kable(exact_result$main_results,
             caption = "Exact ANOVA Result")
```

The results of the simulation are indeed very close to 80.777%. Note that the simulation calculates Cohen's dz effect sizes for paired comparisons - which here given the correlation of 0.5 is also 0.5 for a medium effect size. 

We should see a larger dz if we increase the correlation, keeping the sample size the same, following the example in Gpower above. We repeat the simulation, and the only difference is a correlation between dependent variables of 0.7. This should yield an effect size dz = `r 0.5/sqrt(2*(1-0.7))`.

```{r}
K <- 2
n <- 21
sd <- 1
r <- 0.7
alpha = 0.05
f <- 0.25
f2 <- f^2
ES <- f2/(f2 + 1)
ES
mu <- mu_from_ES(K = K, ES = ES)
design = paste(K,"w",sep = "")
labelnames <- c("speed", "fast", "slow")
design_result <- ANOVA_design(design = design,
                   n = n, 
                   mu = mu, 
                   sd = sd, 
                   r = r, 
                   labelnames = labelnames)

alpha_level <- 0.05

design_result$sigmatrix

simulation_result <- ANOVA_power(design_result, 
                                 alpha_level = alpha_level, 
                                 nsims = nsims,
                                 verbose = FALSE)

knitr::kable(simulation_result$main_results,
             caption = "Simulated ANOVA Result")

exact_result <- ANOVA_exact(design_result,
                            alpha_level = alpha_level,
                            verbose = FALSE)

knitr::kable(exact_result$main_results,
             caption = "Exact ANOVA Result")

```


```{r}
#relation dz and f for within designs 
f <- 0.5*0.6454972
#  
```

Entering this f in G*power, with a correlation of 0.5, yields the same as entering `f = 0.25` and `correlation = 0.7`.

## Repeated Measures-ANOVA Part 2

Here, we will examine a repeated measures experiment with 3 within-subject conditions, to illustrate how a repeated measures ANOVA extends a dependent *t*-test with 3 groups. 

In the example for a two-group within design we provided a specific formula for the sample size benefit for two groups. The sample size needed in within-designs (NW) with more than 2 conditions, relative to the sample needed in between-designs (NB), assuming normal distributions and compound symmetry, and ignoring the difference in degrees of freedom between the two types of tests, is (from Maxwell & Delaney, 2004, p. 562, formula 47): 

$N_{W}=\frac{N_{B}(1-\rho)}{a}$

Where a is the number of within-subject levels. 

### The relation between Cohen's f and Cohen's d

Whereas in the case of a repeated measures ANOVA with 2 groups we could explain the principles of a power analysis by comparing our test against a *t*-test and Cohen's d, this becomes more difficult when we have more than 2 groups. It is more useful to explain how to directly calculate Cohen's f, the effect size used in power analyses for ANOVA. Cohen's f is calculated following Cohen, 1988, formula 8.2.1 and 8.2.2:

$f = \sqrt{\frac{\frac{\sum(\mu-\overline{\mu})^2)}N}\sigma}$ 

Imagine we have a within-subject experiment with 3 conditions. We ask people what they mood is when their alarm clock wakes them up, when they wake up naturally on a week day, and when they wake up naturally on a weekend day. Based on pilot data, we expect the means (on a 7 point validated mood scale) are 3.8, 4.2, and 4.3. The standard deviation is 0.9, and the correlation between the dependent measurements is 0.7. We can calculate Cohen's f for the ANOVA, and Cohen's dz for the contrasts:

```{r}
mu <- c(3.8, 4.2, 4.3)
sd <- 0.9
f <- sqrt(sum((mu - mean(mu)) ^ 2) / length(mu)) / sd 
#Cohen, 1988, formula 8.2.1 and 8.2.2
  f
  r <- 0.7
  (4.2 - 3.8) / 0.9 / sqrt(2 * (1 - r))
  (4.3 - 3.8) / 0.9 / sqrt(2 * (1 - r))
  (4.3 - 4.2) / 0.9 / sqrt(2 * (1 - r))
```

The relation between Cohen's d or dz and Cohen's f becomes more difficult when there are multiple groups, because the relationship depends on the pattern of the means. Cohen (1988) presents calculations for three patterns, minimal variability (for example, for 5 means: -0.25, 0, 0, 0, 0.25), medium variability (for example, for 5 means: -0.25, -0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25 or -0.25, -0.25, -0.25, 0.25, 0.25). For these three patterns, formula's are available that compute Cohen's f from Cohen's d, where d is the effect size calculated for the difference between the largest and smallest mean (if the largest mean is 0.25 and the smallest mean is -0.25, 0.25 - -0.25 = 0.5, so d is 0.5 divided by the standard deviation of 0.9). In our example, d would be (4.3-3.8)/0.9 = 0.5555556. If we divide this value by sqrt(2*(1-r)) we have dz = 0.5555556/0.7745967 = 0.7172191. 

I have created a custom function that will calculate f from d, based on a specification of one of the three patterns of means. Our pattern is most similar (but not identical) to a maximum variability pattern (two means are high, one is lower). So we could attempt to calculate f from d (0.5555556), by calculating d from the largest and smallest mean:

```{r}
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lakens/ANOVA_power_simulation/master/calc_f_d_eta.R")
res <- calc_f_d_eta(mu = mu, sd = sd, variability = "maximum")
res$f
res$d
```

We see the Cohen's f value is 0.2618914 and d = 0.5555556. The Cohen's f is not perfectly accurate - it is assuming the pattern of means is 3.8, 4.3, 4.3, and not 3.8, 4.2, 4.3. If the means and sd is known, it is best to calculate Cohen's f directly from these values.

### Three within conditions, medium effect size

We can perform power analyses for within designs using simuations. We set groups to 3 for the simulation, n = 20, and the correlation between dependent variables to 0.8. If the true effect size is f = 0.25, and the alpha level is 0.05, the power is 96.6%. 

In this case, we simulate data with means -0.3061862, 0.0000000, and 0.3061862, and set the sd to 1. 

```{r}
K <- 3
n <- 20
sd <- 1
r <- 0.8
alpha = 0.05
f <- 0.25
f2 <- f^2
ES <- f2 / (f2 + 1)
ES
mu <- mu_from_ES(K = K, ES = ES)

#Cohen, 1988, formula 8.2.1 and 8.2.2
sqrt(sum((mu - mean(mu)) ^ 2) / length(mu)) / sd 

design = paste(K, "w", sep = "")
labelnames <- c("speed", "fast", "medium", "slow")
design_result <- ANOVA_design(design = design,
                   n = n, 
                   mu = mu, 
                   sd = sd, 
                   r = r, 
                   labelnames = labelnames)

alpha_level <- 0.05

simulation_result <- ANOVA_power(design_result, 
                                 alpha_level = alpha_level, 
                                 nsims = nsims,
                                 verbose = FALSE)

knitr::kable(simulation_result$main_results,
             caption = "Simulated ANOVA Result")

exact_result <- ANOVA_exact(design_result,
                            alpha_level = alpha_level,
                            verbose = FALSE)

knitr::kable(exact_result$main_results,
             caption = "Exact ANOVA Result")
```

The results of the simulation are indeed very close to 96.9%. We can see this is in line with the power estimate from Gpower: 

![](screenshots/gpower_12.png)

We can also validate this by creating the code to do a power analysis in R from scratch: 

```{r}
K <- 3 #three groups
n <- 20
sd <- 1
r <- 0.8
alpha = 0.05
f <- 0.25
f2 <- f^2
ES <- f2 / (f2 + 1)
ES
mu <- mu_from_ES(K = K, ES = ES)
design = paste(K, "w", sep = "")
labelnames <- c("speed", "fast", "medium", "slow")
design_result <- ANOVA_design(design = design,
                   n = n, 
                   mu = mu, 
                   sd = sd, 
                   r = r, 
                   labelnames = labelnames)

power_oneway_within(design_result)$power
power_oneway_within(design_result)$eta_p_2
power_oneway_within(design_result)$eta_p_2_SPSS
power_oneway_within(design_result)$Cohen_f
power_oneway_within(design_result)$Cohen_f_SPSS
```

We can even check the calculation of Cohen's f SPSS style in GPower. We take the GPower settings as illustrated above. We click the 'Options' button, and check the radiobutton next to 'As in SPSS'. Click ok, and you will notice that the 'Corr among rep measures' field has disappeared. The correlation does not need to be entered seperately, but is incorporated in Cohen's f. The value of Cohen's f, which was 0.25, has changed into 0.7024394. This is the SPSS equivalent. The value is much larger. This value, and it's corresponding partial eta-squared, incorporate the correlation between observations.

## Part 3

We first repeat the simulation by Brysbaert:

```{r}
# give sample size
N = 75
# give effect size d
d1 = .4 #difference between the extremes
d2 = .4 #third condition goes with the highest extreme
# give the correlation between the conditions

nSim = nsims
# give alpha levels
alpha1 = .05 #alpha level for the omnibus ANOVA
alpha2 = .05 #also adjusted from original by DL
# create progress bar in case it takes a while

for (i in 1:nSim) {
  #for each simulated experiment
  # setWinProgressBar(pb, i, title=paste(round(i/nSim*100, 1), "% done"))
  data = mvrnorm(n = N,
  mu = c(0, 0, 0),
  Sigma = rho)
  data[, 2] = data[, 2] + d1
  data[, 3] = data[, 3] + d2
  datalong = c(data[, 1], data[, 2], data[, 3])
  conds = factor(rep(letters[24:26], each = N))
  partID = factor(rep(part, times = 3))
  output <- data.frame(partID, conds, datalong)
  test <- aov(datalong ~ conds + Error(partID / conds), data = output)
  tests <- (summary(test))
  p1[i] <- tests$'Error: partID:conds'[[1]]$'Pr(>F)'[[1]]
  p2[i] <- t.test(data[, 1], data[, 2], paired = TRUE)$p.value
  p3[i] <- t.test(data[, 1], data[, 3], paired = TRUE)$p.value
  p4[i] <- t.test(data[, 2], data[, 3], paired = TRUE)$p.value
}
#close(pb)#close progress bar
#printing all unique tests (adjusted code by DL)
sum(p1 < alpha1) / nSim
sum(p2 < alpha2) / nSim
sum(p3 < alpha2) / nSim
sum(p4 < alpha2) / nSim
```


## Reproducing Brysbaert

We can reproduce the same results as Brysbaeert finds with his code: 


```{r}
design <- "3w"
n <- 75
mu <- c(0, 0.4, 0.4)
sd <- 1
r <- 0.5
labelnames <- c("speed", "fast", "medium", "slow")
```
We create the within design, and run the simulation

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
design_result <- ANOVA_design(design = design,
                   n = n, 
                   mu = mu, 
                   sd = sd, 
                   r = r, 
                   labelnames = labelnames)

simulation_result <- ANOVA_power(design_result, 
                                 alpha_level = alpha_level, 
                                 nsims = nsims,
                                 verbose = FALSE)

knitr::kable(simulation_result$main_results,
             caption = "Simulated ANOVA Result")

exact_result <- ANOVA_exact(design_result,
                            alpha_level = alpha_level,
                            verbose = FALSE)

knitr::kable(exact_result$main_results,
             caption = "Exact ANOVA Result")

```

### Results

The results of the simulation are very similar. Power for the ANOVA *F*-test is around 95.2%. For the three paired t-tests, power is around 92.7. This is in line with the a-priori power analysis when using g*power:

![](screenshots/gpower_2.png)

We can perform an post-hoc power analysis in G*power. We can calculate Cohen´s f based on the means and sd, using our own custom formula. 

```{r}
# Our simulation is based onthe following means and sd:
# mu <- c(0, 0.4, 0.4)
# sd <- 1
# Cohen, 1988, formula 8.2.1 and 8.2.2
f <- sqrt(sum((mu - mean(mu)) ^ 2) / length(mu)) / sd 

# We can see why f = 0.5*d.
# Imagine 2 group, mu = 1 and 2
# Grand mean is 1.5, we have sqrt(sum(0.5^2 + 0.5^2)/2), or sqrt(0.5/2), = 0.5.
# For Cohen's d we use the difference, 2-1 = 1. 
```

The Cohen´s f is `r f`. We can enter the f (using the default 'as in G*Power 3.0' in the option window) and enter a sample size of 75, number of groups as 1, number of measurements as 3, correlation as 0.5. This yields:

  test <- aov(datalong ~ conds + Error(partID / conds), data = output)
  tests <- (summary(test))
  p1[i] <- tests$'Error: partID:conds'[[1]]$'Pr(>F)'[[1]]
  p2[i] <- t.test(data[, 1], data[, 2], paired = TRUE)$p.value
  p3[i] <- t.test(data[, 1], data[, 3], paired = TRUE)$p.value
  p4[i] <- t.test(data[, 2], data[, 3], paired = TRUE)$p.value
}

sum(p1 < alpha1) / nSim
sum(p2 < alpha2) / nSim
sum(p3 < alpha2) / nSim
sum(p4 < alpha2) / nSim
```

```{r}
design <- "3w"
n <- 75
mu <- c(0, 0.4, 0.4)
sd <- 1
r <- 0.6
labelnames <- c("speed", "fast", "medium", "slow")
```

We create the within design, and run the simulation.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
design_result <- ANOVA_design(design = design,
                   n = n, 
                   mu = mu, 
                   sd = sd, 
                   r = r, 
                   labelnames = labelnames)

simulation_result <- ANOVA_power(design_result, 
                                 alpha_level = alpha_level, 
                                 nsims = nsims,
                                 verbose = FALSE)

knitr::kable(simulation_result$main_results,
             caption = "Simulated ANOVA Result")

exact_result <- ANOVA_exact(design_result,
                            alpha_level = alpha_level,
                            verbose = FALSE)

knitr::kable(exact_result$main_results,
             caption = "Exact ANOVA Result")
```



Again, this is similar to G*Power for the ANOVA:
