### 2x2 ANOVA, within design

Potvin & Schutz (2000) simulate a wide range of repeated measure designs. They give an example of a 3x3 design, with the following correlation matrix:

![](screenshots/PS2000.png)

Variances were set to 1 (so all covariance matrices in their simulations were identical). In this specific example, the white fields are related to the correlation for the A main effect (these cells have the same level for B, but different levels of A). The grey cells are related to the main effect of B (the cells have the same level of A, but different levels of B). Finally, the black cells are related to the AxB interaction (they have different levels of A and B). The diagonal (all 1) relate to cells with the same levels of A and B. 

Potvin & Schulz (2000) examine power for 2x2 within ANOVA designs and develop approximations of the error variance. For a design with 2 within factors (A and B) these are: 

For the main effect of A:
$\sigma _ { e } ^ { 2 } = \sigma ^ { 2 } ( 1 - \overline { \rho } _ { A } ) + \sigma ^ { 2 } ( q - 1 ) ( \overline { \rho } _ { B } - \overline { \rho } _ { AB } )$

For the main effectof B:
$\sigma _ { e } ^ { 2 } = \sigma ^ { 2 } ( 1 - \overline { \rho } _ { B } ) + \sigma ^ { 2 } ( p - 1 ) ( \overline { \rho } _ { A } - \overline { \rho } _ { A B } )$

For the interaction between A and B:
$\sigma _ { e } ^ { 2 } = \sigma ^ { 2 } ( 1 - \rho _ { \max } ) - \sigma ^ { 2 } ( \overline { \rho } _ { \min } - \overline { \rho } _ { AB } )$

Let's now compare the formulas in Potvin and Schutz (2000) with `Superpower` with a simple scenario.  

```{r include = FALSE}
library(Superpower)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
load("mixed_data.RData")
```
```{r}
mu = c(2,1,4,2) 
n <- 20
sd <- 5
r <- .77
string = "2w*2w"
alpha_level <- 0.05


design_result <- ANOVA_design(design = string,
                              n = n, 
                              mu = mu, 
                              sd = sd, 
                              r = r, 
                              labelnames = labelnames,
                              plot = TRUE)

design_result$cor_mat
```
```{r}
exact_result <- ANOVA_exact(design_result,
                            alpha_level = alpha_level,
                            verbose = FALSE)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(exact_result$main_results,
             caption = "Exact ANOVA Result") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")
```

Further, as we use the analytical solution below, the variance components should be equal to the corresponding MSE from the `ANOVA_exact` produced `anova_table` object.

```{r}
exact_result$aov_result$anova_table
```


We can try to use the formula in Potvin & Schutz (2000).

```{r}
k <- 1 #one group (because all factors are within)

rho_A <- .77 #mean r for factor A

rho_B <- .77 #mean r for factor B

rho_AB <- .77 #mean r for factor AB

alpha <- 0.05

sigma <- sd

m_A <- 2 #levels factor A

variance_e_A <- (sigma^2 * (1 - rho_A) + 
  sigma^2 * (m_A - 1) * (rho_B - rho_AB) )
#Variance A
variance_e_A

m_B <- 2 #levels factor B

variance_e_B <- sigma^2 * (1 - rho_B) + 
  sigma^2 * (m_B - 1) * (rho_A - rho_AB)
#Variance B
variance_e_B

variance_e_AB <-
  (sigma ^ 2 * (1 - max(rho_A, rho_B)) - 
     sigma ^ 2 * (min(rho_A,rho_B) - rho_AB)) 
#Variance AB
variance_e_AB

#Create a mean matrix
mean_mat <- t(matrix(mu, nrow = m_B,ncol = m_A)) 
mean_mat

# Potvin & Schutz, 2000, formula 2, p. 348
# For main effect A
lambda_A <-
  (n * m_A * sum((rowMeans(mean_mat) - 
                   mean(rowMeans(mean_mat))) ^ 2) ) / variance_e_A
  lambda_A

#calculate degrees of freedom 1 - ignoring the sphericity correction
df1 <- (m_A - 1) 

df2 <- (n - k) * (m_A - 1) #calculate degrees of freedom 2

F_critical <- qf(alpha, # critical F-vaue
                 df1,
                 df2, 
                 lower.tail = FALSE) 

pow_A <- pf(qf(alpha, #power 
             df1, 
             df2, 
             lower.tail = FALSE), 
          df1, 
          df2, 
          lambda_A, 
          lower.tail = FALSE)
pow_A*100

lambda_B <-
  n * m_B * sum((colMeans(mean_mat) - 
                   mean(colMeans(mean_mat))) ^ 2) / variance_e_B 
lambda_B

df1 <- (m_B - 1) #calculate degrees of freedom 1

df2 <- (n - k) * (m_B - 1) #calculate degrees of freedom 2

F_critical <- qf(alpha, # critical F-vaue
                 df1,
                 df2,
                 lower.tail = FALSE) 

pow_B <- pf(qf(alpha, #power 
             df1, 
             df2, 
             lower.tail = FALSE), 
          df1, 
          df2, 
          lambda_B, 
          lower.tail = FALSE)


pow_B*100
```


```{r }
#Peform double summation courtesy of Andrew Vigotsky
term <- 0
for (i in 1:nrow(mean_mat)) {
  for (j in 1:ncol(mean_mat)) {
    term <- (term + (mean_mat[i,j] - 
                       mean(mean_mat[i,]) - 
                       mean(mean_mat[,j]) + mean(mean_mat))^2)
  }
}
term

#Calculate lambda for interaction term
lambda_AB <- n*term/variance_e_AB
lambda_AB



df1 <- (m_A - 1) * (m_B - 1)  #calculate degrees of freedom 1
df2 <-
(n - k) * (m_A - 1) * (m_B - 1) #calculate degrees of freedom 2
F_critical <- qf(alpha, # critical F-vaue
df1,
df2,
lower.tail = FALSE)

pow_AB <- pf(qf(alpha, #power
df1,
df2,
lower.tail = FALSE),
df1,
df2,
lambda_AB,
lower.tail = FALSE)

pow_AB*100
```

We can now compile all the analytical results into a single table, and see that the results match those from `ANOVA_exact`.

```{r echo = FALSE}
power <- c(pow_A, pow_B, pow_AB)
lambda <- c(lambda_A, lambda_B, lambda_AB)
variance <- c(variance_e_A, variance_e_B, variance_e_AB)

dat_analytical <- data.frame(variance, lambda, power)

dat_analytical$power = dat_analytical$power*100

knitr::kable(dat_analytical,
             caption = "Analytical Result") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")
```

And we can see in the simple scenario matches `ANOVA_exact` and `ANOVA_power` output.

Let's now extend to one of the simlations presented by Potvin and Schultz with a 3x3 solution.

```{r}
mu = c(2,1,4,
       2,.5,3,
       2,0,6) 
n <- 20
sd <- 5
r <- c(1.0,0.8,0.8,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,
       0.8,1.0,0.8,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,
       0.8,0.8,1.0,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,
       0.4,0.4,0.4,1.0,0.8,0.8,0.4,0.4,0.4,
       0.4,0.4,0.4,0.8,1.0,0.8,0.4,0.4,0.4,
       0.4,0.4,0.4,0.8,0.8,1.0,0.4,0.4,0.4,
       0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,1.0,0.8,0.8,
       0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.8,1.0,0.8,
       0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.8,0.8,1.0)


string = "3w*3w"
alpha_level <- 0.05

design_result <- ANOVA_design(design = string,
                              n = n, 
                              mu = mu, 
                              sd = sd, 
                              r = r, 
                              plot = TRUE)

design_result$cor_mat
```

The design now matches the correlation matrix in Figure 1 of Potvin and Schultz.

And we can estimate power with `ANOVA_exact`.

```{r}
exact_result <- ANOVA_exact(design_result,
                            alpha_level = alpha_level,
                            verbose = FALSE)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(exact_result$main_results,
             caption = "Exact ANOVA Result") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")
```

Further, as we use the analytical solution below, the variance components should be equal to the corresponding MSE from the `ANOVA_exact` produced `anova_table` object.

```{r}
exact_result$aov_result$anova_table
```

```{r}

Again, when we compile all the analytical results into a single table we can see that the results match those from `ANOVA_exact`.

dat_analytical <- data.frame(variance, lambda, power)

dat_analytical$power = dat_analytical$power*100

knitr::kable(dat_analytical,
             caption = "Analytical Result") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")
